# Authenticated-API
Seems like a really tough project... Sigh
My search online asked me to install Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer. 
My project just don't want to reference my Models folder. Online suggestions wants me to create a seperate SecurityDbContext.cs.

Created SecurityDbContext.cs but still have issues with my controllers.
